--------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix questions (since there are not enough of these in UVa):

1)
Given an n x n matrix A(i,j) of integers, find maximum value A(c,d) - A(a,b) over all choices of indexes such that both c > a and d > b.
Required complexity: O(n^2)

2)
Given an NxM (N rows and M columns) integer matrix with non-negative values (0..MAX_INT inclusive). What is the maximum sum from going top left (0, 0) to bottom right (N-1, M-1) ? The condition is that when you're at point (p, q), you can only move to either right (p, q+1) or down (p+1, q).

Expected time complexity O(N*M)
Expected space complexity O(N+M)

From the space complexity it looks like there is a DP solution, but I couldn't figure it out.

3)
"Min(Max elements rows) not less than Max(Min of columns)"
can you tell me whether above statement ist true or false..
if it true, then tell me solutoin.
if it false, then tell me example

4)
Given an n-by-n matrix of 0's and 1's where all 1's in each row come before all 0's, find the most efficient way to return the row with the maximum number of 0's.

5)
given a number n... print a spiral matrix in O(1) space example if n=5 the op should be:

25 24 23 22 21
10 09 08 07 20
11 02 01 06 19
12 03 04 05 18
13 14 15 16 17

The question may appear trivial but its not...u hav to print in O(1) space

6)
given a matrix pxq
You start from top left and have to reach the bottom right. Can only traverse right or bottom
How many ways are there to reach at the bottom right?
