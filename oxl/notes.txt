TODO: Create ads_recommendation.csv from user x cat pairs in user_messages_test.csv

Terminology:

Recommendation: Ad that has been recommended for a specific user and category in user_messages.csv
Impression: Ad viewed by a user according to user_data.csv


Step 1: Check out the data.

user_data.csv

This file contains 2.143.889 rows with information for 12.365 unique users. 
Some of the columns are not documented correctly in the problem setting, or there is significant amounts of data missing:

    "event_time": This is a real time stamp down to seconds rather than the stated milliseconds.

    "channel": I choose to ignore this data due to time constraints.

    "origin": This column can contain the following values: "browse", "browse_search", "home", "notification_center", "search", "push", "drawer" "" (the empty string) and "deeplink". While the meaning of most of these can be guessed, it should really be documented better.

    "images_count": While it makes sense not to show ads without images (research say they do porly), I have chosen to ignore this parameter.

    "ad_impressions", "ad_views" and "ad_messages". These columns are sparsely documented, so I have chosen to simply add their values for any further processing.


ads_data.csv

This file contains a wonderful amount of useful data. However. I only have a couple of hours on my hands, so I'm going to completely ignore this file.


user_messages.csv

I'm going to use this file to get suggestions for categories. It contains 10348 lines with users in 10 categories. 


Attempt 1: Trivial category matching: 5.45 points

Here I simply repeated the first entry for a given category in "user_messages.csv" while completely ignoring the user. This is obviously a poorly performing algorithm, but serves as a good starting point to see if the file is formatted correctly.


Attempt 2: Nearest user matching: 28.28 points

Instead of taking the first user and copying their data from "user_messages.csv", the one with the closest distance is chosen.


Attempt 3: Last viewed: 147.07

Simply show the (up to 10) last viewed ads by the user. They might not have bought these items, so perhaps they want to see them again.
Notice that 1635 rows were for users which are not in user_data.csv and their recommendations are thus empty.

Attempt 4: Most recommended ads for unknown users: 9.79 points
For users not seen in user_data.csv: Add most highly recommended ads in category. The predictor fails for these users, so these 9.79 points are easy to add to any other submission.
